/**
 Class for a fibre.
 
 A Fibre is a light-weight thread that allows a task to use different stacks and 
 environments quickly, but prohibts running consecutively, avoiding collisions
 and race conditions.
 
 A Fibre is created at a non-timecritical initialisation phase, putting the 
 fibre in "stopped" state.
 
 When stopped, the main program can launch a new Fibre using Run(). The main 
 thread is suspended and the fibre is set to "running".
 
 When runnign, the Fibre may suspend itself. This will cause Run() to return
 a non-zero value. The main thread will resume in the main context. The Fibre
 is in "suspended" mode and can only continue via Resume().
 
 When running the Fibre call will eventually return, putting the Fibre back into
 "stopped" mode. Run() will return 0 and the main thread will resume in 
 the main context.

// ============================================================================= //
//         There was once a programmer who was attached to the court of the      //
// warlord of Wu.  The warlord asked the programmer: "Which is easier to design: //
// an accounting package or an operating system?"                                //
//         "An operating system," replied the programmer.                        //
//         The warlord uttered an exclamation of disbelief.  "Surely an          //
// accounting package is trivial next to the complexity of an operating          //
// system," he said.                                                             //
//         "Not so," said the programmer, "when designing an accounting package, //
// the programmer operates as a mediator between people having different ideas:  //
// how it must operate, how its reports must appear, and how it must conform to  //
// the tax laws.  By contrast, an operating system is not limited by outside     //
// appearances.  When designing an operating system, the programmer seeks the    //
// simplest harmony between machine and ideas.  This is why an operating system  //
// is easier to design."                                                         //
//         The warlord of Wu nodded and smiled.  "That is all good and well, but //
// which is easier to debug?"                                                    //
//         The programmer made no reply.                                         //
//                 -- Geoffrey James, "The Tao of Programming"                   //
